<!--The purpose of semantic tags is to break down the code into structural sections for the user. It allows the programmer to differentiate the purpose of different text. The browser follows the order of the html file. Headers and footers are placed at the top and bottom of the body respectively. During this challenge I learned that using snippets is very helpful, it allows the developer to quickly to search for templates, saving time. I will definitely be using them in the future. I found it hard to set up my snippets, I need to do more research on them. Since I didn't have a certain path for my file, it was hard for me to create a snippet that would make sense. -->
