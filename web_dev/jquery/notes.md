- find a cheat sheet or docs file for jquery functions 
- read through the file and test some functions in command line


- find videos on jquery with examples 
- code along with the video 

- find a source that connects jquery with other languages like CSS 
- practice some examples in the command line or repl.it

after doing research I found the best way for me to learn jquery was through watching videos on youtube and programming along with the instructor. After practicing the code I used a cheat sheet I found to change some of the code from the video to see how different jquery attributes affected the code for the html file.
