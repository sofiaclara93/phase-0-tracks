**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?

Version control allows access to any revisions of a file and allows all of those revisions to be merged together. Version control give a group of users access to a document. It is useful when a user makes a mistake because it gives access to go back in the file's history to avoid that mistake again. 
* What is a branch and why would you use one?

A branch is a copy of a file. It gives access to users to make changes to the a copy which then can be integrated back in to the master (or original) branch. You would use one so each user can make their own changes or additions to be integrated into the original file. 

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?

A commit is essentially a saving point for a file. The message describes why changes were made and why the file was saved. A good message has details about what was saved since the previous version of the file. 

* What is a merge conflict?

A merge conflict occurs when a change in the same file negate other changes in the file. For example if there are two branches and each one makes changes to the same line of the file, there is a conflict when merging because there is no way of deciding which line is to be chosen. Another example is if someone chooses to delete a portion, but another branch chooses to edit that portion of code.
